These services typically allow users to fund their accounts using bank transfers or credit\/debit cards and then use the funds to buy cryptocurrency on an exchange or other platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An off-ramp service, on the other hand, allows users to convert their cryptocurrency back into fiat currency. These services typically allow users to sell their cryptocurrency on the platform and withdraw the proceeds to a bank account or other financial account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On-ramp and off-ramp services can be useful for individuals and businesses that want to use cryptocurrency as a means of exchange or store of value, but also want the option to easily convert their cryptocurrency back into fiat currency when needed. These services can also be useful for people who want to buy or sell cryptocurrency but do not have a way to directly exchange it with others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Terms of Service<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These terms of service (the &#8220;Terms&#8221;) govern your use of our on-ramp and off-ramp service (the &#8220;Service&#8221;) for the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency using fiat currency.

You should carefully consider whether purchasing or selling cryptocurrency is suitable for you in light of your financial situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Limitation of Liability<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your use of the Service, including loss of cryptocurrency or loss of profits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Governing Law<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These Terms will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Italy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Changes to the Terms<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time.
