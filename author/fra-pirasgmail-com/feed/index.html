<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Guilds project is selected for funding by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trublo.eu/guilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.trublo.eu/guilds/">Trublo.eu</a>&nbsp;consortium to develop a blockchain based solution for trust and reputation management.</h5>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">The GUILDS project.</h6>



<p>The pandemic linked to COVID-19 has forced the world economy to resort to <strong>remote work</strong>. Often contracts must be concluded remotely, safely and efficiently yet the budget is low to access traditional legal services in case of disputes. A large amount of e-business and freelancing transactions is happening through centralized freelancing job boards, like Fiverr, Upwork and a few other incumbents. Such marketplaces dictate conditions, fees, money-retain policies, and among others <strong>reputation</strong>.</p>



<p>No matter how vast your expertise is, once you join a platform you restart your profile from scratch, and the reputation is built inside someone elseâ€™s land. At any moment your account can be closed or your reputation score reset by a centralized action. This affects not only professional services but international trade and e-commerce as well.</p>



<p>With the rise of blockchains, <strong>decentralized Self-Sovereign Identities</strong> and smart contracts we envision that no central authority should be in the position to manipulate the reputation inside an ecosystem and reviews should be portable and verifiable. We envision <em><strong>GUILDS </strong>as a protocol suite and tools for a transparent, immutable and auditable reputation backed by a solid game theory</em>. </p>



<p>GUILDS focus is on Trust and reputation models on <strong>Blockchains</strong>.</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Blockchain experience</h6>



<p>The project Guilds will be developed by <strong><a href="https://uncommon-digital.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://uncommon-digital.it/">Uncommon Digital Srl</a></strong>, an Italian start-up company with the vision of a world where everyone can make business online without barriers and without intermediaries.&nbsp;The company is one year old but the founders have more than 20 years of experience in the software industry and technology. </p>



<p><strong>Our mission is to develop tools and smart legal contracts to protect payments, build trust, manage online reputation and prevent disputes.</strong></p>



<p>As a company, our main achievement is the <strong>Uncommon Creative </strong>project, a blockchain-based solution to create programmable <strong>escrows </strong>and manage disputes (<a href="https://uniscrow.com/" title="https://uniscrow.com/">Uniscrow</a>). The company has received a grant from the Algorand Foundation to implement such a concept with the Algorand protocol.&nbsp;Our team has developed blockchain solutions for a number of partners and customers. The proponents as individuals have implemented solutions in the field of crypto exchanges, payments, ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, dApps in Ethereum and Algorand.</p>



<p>The company has recently joined two startup incubators (TheNetValue and Abinsula) to access a pool of experts not only in technology but also in law and business strategy.</p>
